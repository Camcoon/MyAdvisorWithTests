# MyAdvisor Assignment 2 — User Acceptance Test Plan

> **Approved-allocation update ? 27 October 2026:** [Current correction record](../reports/degree-requirement-correction.md) supersedes earlier allocation-pending statements and the 735-build attribution for the changed source. Approved fictional category requirements are Core 36, General Education 18, Electives 12, Major 18, Additional 9 (total 93), not official UWI requirements. Historical results/images and synthetic test fixtures below remain preserved. New Postman/manual acceptance remains pending; no old screenshot is relabelled as this build.

## Current approved Degree Progress oracle

For a new corrected-build execution of UAT-01, use Core 3/36 (33 remaining, 8%), General Education 3/18 (15, 17%), Electives 0/12, Major 0/18, Additional 0/9; category requirements total 93. Overall remains 6 completed / 3 in progress / 84 remaining / 93 required / 6%. Read the fictional-data notice, verify activity and compare after refresh. The earlier 120-credit baseline below is the preserved historical plan version; it is superseded for this new execution, not rewritten as an earlier observation. Use [the new blank UAT-01 record](../reports/degree-progress-retest.md), preserve original `screenshots/UAT/UAT-02.png`, and retain the original remaining conditions for the other 19 cases. No new manual result has been recorded.



**Correction-stage supplement ? 27 October 2026:** original IDs, inputs and expected outcomes below are retained. [Additional correction coverage](../reports/requirements-test-traceability.md) documents focused HTML role, actual-engine integrity, registration and contrast regressions. [Actual corrected-build results](../reports/audit-correction-report.md) are separate from historical marked/manual runs. [Required browser/API retests](../reports/correction-retest-guide.md) remain pending; no expected outcome has been promoted to an observation. F05 curriculum values are unchanged pending owner approval.

**Current execution disposition (27 October 2026):** 1 Pass / 0 Fail / 19 Not Run across the 20-case execution companion; 18 cases are partially verified and UAT-05 is unverified. The preparation-stage Not Run fields below are historical. See the [execution companion](../reports/uat-execution.md) and [final quality audit](../final-quality-audit.md). Original planned inputs/expected results remain unchanged.

Prepared: 26 October 2026. Version: 1.1. State: **Ready for review; all cases Not Run**.

## Execution companion and accuracy review — 26 October 2026

Use the [final manual execution sheet and detailed browser walkthrough](../reports/uat-execution.md) to execute UAT. It preserves UAT-01–17 and adds UAT-18 Student login, UAT-19 Advisor login, and UAT-20 demonstrable browser role restrictions. Its physical case order is the execution order: UAT-18, UAT-01–05, UAT-19, UAT-06–17, UAT-20. All 20 execution cases are **Not Run**.

Reviewed against the original wireframe, current HTML interfaces/navigation/login, workflow routes, authentication/error handling, seed data and plan transitions, and project documentation. Existing workflow expectations remain applicable. The companion replaces the generic setup below for final execution: it supplies exact commands for a fresh disposable SQLite database and dedicated local port 5002, seeded credentials, browser-profile isolation, evidence/result fields and failure/retry instructions. Its URLs and preconditions take precedence over this plan's port-5000 examples. Do not execute both documents as separate test runs.

The companion records these source-review qualifications: category requirements total 120 versus degree total 93; resubmission clears previous feedback; cancellation retains history; the cancelled-plan submit label says Resubmit despite creating a new plan; Advisor Student-tab requests fall back to Advisor Home, while Student direct `/admin` access is denied. These are inspected expectations/acceptance concerns, not observed manual results. Login and browser role separation are supporting controls outside the three drawn workflow panels. No application changes or manual UAT execution were performed during this review.
## Purpose and basis

Verify that a Student can understand degree progress, choose eligible courses, submit and revise semester plans, see advisor decisions, and cancel plans where permitted; and that an Advisor can review submissions and request changes, approve, or reject them. All execution is manual through the browser. This document records planned expectations from source inspection, not observed execution results.

Original Assignment 1 reference: [Three-Panel Student Advisor Dashboard Mockup](../../wireframes/Three-Panel%20Student%20Advisor%20Dashboard%20Mockup.png).

| Reference | Original wireframe component | Current browser equivalent |
|---|---|---|
| W1 | Panel 1: Track Degree Progress (Student); Overall Progress, four credit cards, Requirement Breakdown, Recent Activity | **Degree Progress**; Overall progress, Completed, In progress, Remaining, Total required, Requirement breakdown, Recent course activity |
| W2 | Panel 2: Plan Semester Course Selections (Student); semester dropdown, search, department filter, course checkboxes, Selected Courses, Next, Review Plan, Submit | **Plan Courses**; Semester, Search by code or course name, All departments, course checkboxes, selection count, Review Selected Courses, Back to course selection, Submit Plan for Advisor Review |
| W3 | Panel 3: Review and Approve Course Plan (Advisor); Student Plans, student summary, selected-course table, Comments (optional), Approve, Reject, Request Changes | **Advisor Review**; Student plan review, student summary, Selected courses, Comments (optional), Approve Plan, Reject Plan, Request Changes |
| W4 | Student Messages navigation in panels 1–2; feedback implied by panel 3 decisions | **Messages** and Plan Courses status/feedback; Home latest-plan summary |
| W5 | Extension of panel 2 planning and panel 3 decision workflow; cancellation/resubmission controls are not drawn explicitly | **Cancel Plan**, browser confirmation, editable returned plan, Resubmit Plan for Advisor Review |

Implementation references: [student template](../../../app/templates/myadvisor_dashboard.html), [advisor template](../../../app/templates/advisor_dashboard.html), [navigation](../../../app/templates/authenticated-base.html), [workflow rules and demo data](../../../app/services/advising_service.py), [student routes](../../../app/routers/user_home.py), and [advisor routes](../../../app/routers/admin_home.py). Labels and sample values in the original mockup are illustrative: use the actual seeded course codes, semesters, and degree totals below.

## Manual execution setup

- Use an already running, disposable test instance with the existing demo data. Default local base URL is `http://127.0.0.1:5000`; substitute the actual test URL everywhere if different. Do not reset a populated database to run this plan. Environment/data preparation is a prerequisite, outside these browser cases.
- Student account: `bob` / `bobpass` (regular_user). Advisor account: `admin` / `adminpass` (admin). These are documented demo credentials; use the supplied test equivalents if changed. Confirm the Student's displayed name and student ID before matching an Advisor queue card.
- Use separate browser profiles or a normal window and a private window to isolate Student and Advisor sessions. JavaScript must be enabled. Keep both sessions open and refresh after the other actor acts.
- Start with no existing plans for A = `Year 1 semester 1`, B = `Year 1 semester 2`, and C = `Year 1 semester 3`. If those semesters are already occupied, obtain an equivalent prepared test account/instance before execution; do not cancel unrelated plans. Do not modify academic records during the sequence.
- Record the environment: Base URL: ___; build/commit: ___; browser/version: ___; OS: ___; Student identity/ID: ___; Advisor identity: ___; execution date/time zone: ___. Do not include passwords in screenshots.
- Run UAT-01 through UAT-17 in order. A follows submission → changes requested → resubmission → approval → cancellation. B follows submission → rejection → cancellation. C follows submission → pending-course removal → cancellation → new submission. Courses may be reused across these semesters under the current implementation; approval does not itself record academic completion.
- Navigation convention: click the named sidebar link. If the sidebar is collapsed, click **Toggle sidebar** first. For a semester change, choose the exact **Semester** option and wait for the page to reload; unsent selections are not assumed to survive that reload.

### Test data baseline

These values come from the existing demo-data implementation and must be confirmed for the chosen test environment before execution. A mismatch is a setup discrepancy, not evidence of a passed test.

| Data | Expected baseline |
|---|---|
| Student program | Computer Science, 93 total credits |
| Recorded courses | COMP 1101 Introduction to Programming: Completed, 3 credits; MATH 1200 Discrete Mathematics: Completed, 3 credits; COMP 1600 Data Structures: In Progress, 3 credits |
| Progress | Completed 6; In progress 3; Remaining 84; Total required 93; Overall progress 6 / 93 (6%) |
| Category breakdown | Core Courses 3/36, 33 remaining; General Education 3/18, 15 remaining; Electives 0/18, 18 remaining; Major Requirements 0/24, 24 remaining; Additional Requirements 0/24, 24 remaining |
| E1 | COMP 1201 Object-Oriented Programming, 3 credits, Computer Science, prerequisite COMP 1101; eligible |
| E2 | MATH 2250 Industrial Statistics, 3 credits, Mathematics, no prerequisites; eligible |
| E3 | ENGL 1000 Academic Writing, 3 credits, English, no prerequisites; eligible |
| Ineligible examples | COMP 1101: Already completed; COMP 1600: Already in progress; COMP 2100 Database Design: Missing prerequisite(s): COMP 1600 |

The seeded category requirements total 120 while the degree total is 93. This is a source/data inconsistency identified during planning, not an executed failure. Record whether the resulting breakdown is understandable and raise it for review; do not replace the degree total with the mockup's 120 or invent corrected data. If acceptance requires reconciled category totals, this remains an acceptance issue even if the screen matches the current seed.

## Test cases

### UAT-01 — View degree progress

| Field | Detail |
|---|---|
| UAT ID | UAT-01 |
| Actor | Student |
| Objective | Understand completed, current, and remaining degree requirements. |
| Relevant wireframe component | W1: Overall Progress, credit cards, Requirement Breakdown, Recent Activity. |
| Preconditions | Manual setup and baseline confirmed; Student window signed out. |
| Test data | Student demo account; baseline progress and category values above. |

**Exact browser steps**

1. Open `http://127.0.0.1:5000/login` in the Student window.
2. Enter `bob` in **Username**, `bobpass` in **Password**, and click **Sign in**.
3. Click **Degree Progress** in the sidebar.
4. Read Overall progress, all four credit cards, every Requirement breakdown row, and Recent course activity. Capture the displayed values.
5. Refresh the page and compare the values again.

**Expected result:** Student workspace opens. Credits are 6 completed, 3 in progress, 84 remaining, and 93 required; overall progress is 6 / 93 (6%). Breakdown matches the baseline and distinguishes completed from in-progress courses. Recent activity shows the three recorded courses with their correct statuses. Refresh preserves the values. Record the category-total inconsistency noted above for acceptance review.

| Preconditions | UAT-01 completed; Student signed in; A has no plan. |
| Test data | A; E1/E2; search `COMP 1201`, `Industrial Statistics`, and `ZZZ-UAT-NO-COURSE`. |

**Exact browser steps**

1. Click **Plan Courses**. Open **Semester** and inspect the nine Year 1–3/semester 1–3 options; choose **Year 1 semester 1**.
2. Scroll the course list and inspect course codes, titles, credits, departments, prerequisites, and eligibility messages.
3. Enter `COMP 1201` in **Search by code or course name**; inspect the matching row.
4. Replace the search with `Industrial Statistics`; inspect MATH 2250.
5. Clear the search and choose **Mathematics** in the department dropdown; inspect the remaining rows.
6. With Mathematics still selected, search `COMP 1201`; inspect the no-match message, then click **Clear Filters**.
7. Search `ZZZ-UAT-NO-COURSE`; inspect the no-match message and click **Clear Filters** again.

**Expected result:** The chosen semester loads, and semester 3 is identified as summer. E1 and E2 show their documented details. Search matches code or title, and the department filter restricts results. Combined incompatible filters and the nonexistent search show “No courses match your search and department filters.” Clear Filters restores the catalog and All departments. No plan is submitted.

| Test data | E1 and E2 (6 credits); ineligible baseline examples. |

**Exact browser steps**

1. Observe **0 courses selected** and attempt to click **Review Selected Courses**.
2. Locate COMP 1101, COMP 1600, and COMP 2100, scrolling as necessary. Read their eligibility messages and attempt to select each checkbox.
3. Select COMP 1201 and MATH 2250. Check the count, then click **Review Selected Courses**.
4. Read the two reviewed courses, their prerequisites, and **Total selected credits**.
5. Click **Back to course selection**, uncheck MATH 2250, and check the count. Recheck it and click **Review Selected Courses** again.

**Expected result:** Empty selection cannot advance. The three ineligible checkboxes are disabled with the documented reasons; an in-progress prerequisite does not count as completed. Only E1/E2 are selected. The count moves 0 → 2 → 1 → 2; review shows exactly E1/E2 and 6 credits. Returning to selection retains choices. Nothing is submitted yet; leave the browser on review for UAT-04.

**Exact browser steps**

1. Click Student **Plan Courses**, choose A, and confirm its current status is Approved.
2. Click **Cancel Plan** and dismiss the confirmation with **Cancel**; verify A remains Approved with E1/E3.
3. Click **Cancel Plan** again and accept the confirmation with **OK**.
4. Read the success message; refresh and inspect status, selected courses, and available actions.
5. Click **Messages** and find A's status.

**Expected result:** Dismissing cancellation leaves approval unchanged. Confirming shows “Semester plan cancelled. You can edit it and resubmit.” A becomes Cancelled and remains so after refresh; Messages also shows Cancelled. The planning screen clears the active selection, permits a new choice, and hides Cancel Plan. Previous feedback may remain attached to the cancelled record; it must not make the current status appear Approved.

### UAT-15 — Cancel a Rejected plan

| Field | Detail |
|---|---|
| UAT ID | UAT-15 |
| Actor | Student |
| Objective | Cancel B instead of resubmitting the rejected selection. |
| Relevant wireframe component | W5: cancellation extension to returned plan. |
| Preconditions | UAT-11 rejection retained; B Rejected. |
| Test data | B; Rejected → Cancelled. |

**Exact browser steps**

1. Click Student **Plan Courses** and choose B; confirm Rejected and its rejection feedback.
2. Click **Cancel Plan** and accept the confirmation with **OK**.
3. Read the success message, refresh, and inspect the status, selection count, and actions.
4. Click **Messages** and find B's entry.

**Expected result:** B becomes Cancelled and persists after refresh. No active courses are selected; a new selection is possible and Cancel Plan is absent. Messages reports Cancelled. A's cancellation and C's Pending state are unaffected. Retained rejection feedback does not override the current Cancelled status.

### UAT-16 — Cancel a Pending plan and remove it from the review queue

| Field | Detail |
|---|---|
| UAT ID | UAT-16 |
| Actor | Student, then Advisor |
| Objective | Withdraw C before the Advisor makes a decision. |
| Relevant wireframe component | W5: Cancel Plan; W3: Pending review queue. |
| Preconditions | UAT-13 completed; C Pending with E1; no Advisor decision on C. |
| Test data | C; Pending → Cancelled. |

**Exact browser steps**

1. Click Student **Plan Courses**, choose C, and confirm Pending with only COMP 1201.
2. Click **Cancel Plan** and accept the confirmation with **OK**.
3. Read the success message and refresh; inspect the Cancelled banner, selection count, and available actions.
4. Click Student **Messages** and inspect C's status.
5. In the Advisor window click **Advisor Review**, refresh, and look for the Student/C card.

**Expected result:** C becomes Cancelled, the active selection clears, and no repeat cancellation control appears. Student Messages shows Cancelled. The Student/C card is absent from the refreshed Pending queue, so it cannot be reviewed there. Other students' Pending submissions, if any, remain available.

### UAT-17 — Start a new plan after cancellation

| Field | Detail |
|---|---|
| UAT ID | UAT-17 |
| Actor | Student, then Advisor |
| Objective | Submit a fresh selection for the same semester after withdrawing its previous plan. |
| Relevant wireframe component | W2/W5: new selection after cancellation, review and submit; W3: queue. |
| Preconditions | UAT-16 completed; C Cancelled with no active selection. |
| Test data | C; E3 only, 3 credits. |

**Exact browser steps**

1. Click Student **Plan Courses**, choose C, and confirm no course is selected.
2. Select only ENGL 1000 and click **Review Selected Courses**.
3. Confirm ENGL 1000 and 3 credits, then click **Resubmit Plan for Advisor Review** (the implemented label on the cancelled-plan screen).
4. Inspect the resulting Pending status and selected-course list; refresh once.
5. In the Advisor window click **Advisor Review**, refresh, and inspect the Student/C card.

**Expected result:** C's current plan is Pending with only E3 and 3 credits; the previously cancelled E1 selection does not reappear. Advisor queue contains one active Pending C card for this Student with E3. The screen describes this as a brand new plan even though the action label says Resubmit. Historical Cancelled entries may remain in Messages. Do not infer database identifiers from the browser or require deletion of history.

## Recording results and acceptance review

- After executing each case, replace **Actual result** with observed behavior and set **Pass/Fail/Not Run** to Pass or Fail. Enter the tester's name, actual execution date, and filenames of evidence actually captured. The filenames above are suggestions only; no files currently exist as execution evidence from this task.
- If a prerequisite fails or the environment/data is unavailable, leave dependent cases **Not Run** and explain the blocker in Actual result. Do not label an unattempted case Fail or Pass. Record defects with UAT ID, Student/semester, expected versus observed behavior, reproduction steps, and screenshot references.
- Capture status, semester, selection/credit totals, feedback, and confirmation dialogs where relevant. Use suffixes such as `-01`, `-02` for additional screenshots; avoid unrelated personal information. Evidence storage location: ___ (record before running).
- All 17 cases must be executed and their expected outcomes met for full workflow acceptance, with no unresolved defect preventing a required Student or Advisor task. Review the category-total inconsistency explicitly before acceptance; matching the seeded values alone does not resolve it. Any accepted exception needs a named reviewer and written rationale.
- End state if the full sequence succeeds: A Cancelled, B Cancelled, C Pending with E3. No cleanup is performed by this plan; preserve this state until evidence review is complete.

| Review record | Value |
|---|---|
| Passed / Failed / Not Run | 0 / 0 / 17 |
| Outstanding defects / accepted exceptions | Not yet assessed; see source/data inconsistency above. |
| Acceptance decision | Pending execution and review. |

## Current execution reconciliation ? 27 October 2026

The original planned inputs, expected results and preparation-stage summaries above are historical and preserved. Current authoritative [UAT execution](../reports/uat-execution.md) records **1 Pass / 0 Fail / 19 Not Run** (18 partially verified, one unverified workflow), using all 19 actual screenshots and explicit user observations. Tester Cameron Ramesar confirms October 27, 2026 execution. Actual A initial/revised data is 3 courses/9 credits, not the planned 2/6; exact substitutions, remaining substeps and acceptance issues are in the [matrix](../reports/uat-evidence-review.md). Automated outcomes remain 113 unit, 194 integration and 715 full-suite passes; Postman 90 requests/470 assertions passed.
